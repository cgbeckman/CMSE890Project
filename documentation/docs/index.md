# Reproducible Workflow for CDCC Calculations
CMSE890 Fall 2024: Cate Beckman

This website hosts the documentation for a reproducible workflow for a nuclear dynamics calculation. The 
calculation uses the Continuum Discretized Coupled Channels method to obtain reaction observables. On 
this site is a link to the corresponding github repository, which applies the workflow to carbon-15 
elastically scattering on deuteron.
