Respository is for a reproducible workflow to run a breakup calculation. Environment specified in environemnt.yaml file is called CMSEProject890.


Done: 
Added nuclide-data as a submodule. Users that clone the repository may need to use git clone --recursive <project url> in order to get this dependency
Start snakefile. run_input rule works perfectly 

TODO
-fix up the psuedocode 
-fix python rule 
-fix integration rules. They seem to not be working 
-add rule to plot other observables (elastic scattering cross section, mod smatrices, etc)
-make a documentation website
